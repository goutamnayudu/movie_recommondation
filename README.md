I have published a IEEE paper on this movie recommondation topic.
The above given code can able run in the IDLE which is pretty easy to understand and run the code.
This movie recommondation system gives the similar movies that you have entered in the search box.
This recommondation works on the similarity b/w the movies which is calculated from the attributes such as "director","zoner of the movie","movie cast"...
